CPP lib : raspividyuv
Python lib :PiCamera

 	     1280x480 (stereoscopic)	640x240 (stereoscopic)
C++	      40 fps	                90 fps
Python  	15 fps	                20 fps

****But there is a catch. Unlike the C++ solution, Python is much more sensitive to correct FPS configuration. 
If you request substantially more than necessary, youâ€™ll get not the maximum available FPS, but a sharp drop in FPS.
